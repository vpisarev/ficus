# Miscelaneous bits of different usability

* cmakeproj - a sample CMakeLists.txt that can be used to create a project file for IDE, e.g. Visual Studio or Xcode, out of Ficus-generated .c/.cpp sources, including, but not limited to the Ficus compiler itself. Once a project is created, you can debug some difficult-to-catch bugs/crashes that may occur in complex progams.
* Ficus.tmbundle - Ficus syntax highlighting for TextMate, Sublime Text or VSCode.
* fonts - Ficus programming font with ligatures constructed from [iA Writer Mono](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Mono) and [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive).
* ficus1.0.png - a tough way to 1.0 release. See also [the more detailed TODO list](https://github.com/vpisarev/ficus/issues/4)
