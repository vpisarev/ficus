# Found bugs registry

Append-only registry of compiler bugs discovered by the fxtest infrastructure.
The rule (Brief #1): **find and fence bugs, do not fix them.** Each entry is
quarantined (manifest `quarantine=` / suite `xfail`) and stays quarantined until
a future fix lands, at which point CI reports it loudly (XPASS / unexpected
success). This file is the direct input to Brief #2.

Entry template:

```
## FB-NNN  <pass or area>: <one-line symptom>
- repro: <path to test file or inline snippet>
- config: <opt level, platform/compiler>; <expected> vs <got>
- status: quarantined in <manifest entry / suite> as <xfail|crash|skip>
```

## FB-001  C++ backend: interface codegen does not compile under -c++
- symptom: any program defining an `interface` and a `class` implementing it
  compiles & runs correctly as C (default), but under `-c++` the generated C++
  fails to compile. Two errors per iface init site:
    * `cannot initialize an array element of type 'const void *' with an lvalue
       of type 'int (struct ..._data_t *, ..., void *)'`  (C allows fn-ptr ->
       void*, C++ does not), and
    * `no matching function for call to 'fx_init_ifaces'`.
- repro (14 lines, fails under `-c++`, ok under C):
  ```
  interface IShape { fun area(): double }
  class Circle : IShape { r: double }
  fun Circle.area(): double = 3.14159 * self.r * self.r
  val c = Circle {r=2.0}
  val s = (c :> IShape)
  println(s.area())
  ```
- config: `-c++`, macOS/clang (also expected on linux/g++ -- C++ language rule,
  not compiler-specific). Default C build: OK. `-c++`: 2 errors generated.
- discovered by: `fxtest.py corpus --cpp-smoke` (test_all fails: 12 errors, all
  from test_oop.fx which exercises interfaces).
- status: quarantined -- `cpp_xfail` on the `test_all` corpus entry; the -c++
  smoke reports XFAIL and will report XPASS when the codegen is fixed.
