# Found bugs registry

Append-only registry of compiler bugs discovered by the fxtest infrastructure.
The rule (Brief #1): **find and fence bugs, do not fix them.** Each entry is
quarantined (manifest `quarantine=` / suite `xfail`) and stays quarantined until
a future fix lands, at which point CI reports it loudly (XPASS / unexpected
success). This file is the direct input to Brief #2.

Entry template:

```
## FB-NNN  <pass or area>: <one-line symptom>
- repro: <path to test file or inline snippet>
- config: <opt level, platform/compiler>; <expected> vs <got>
- status: quarantined in <manifest entry / suite> as <xfail|crash|skip>
```

## FB-005  Vector `.wrap[-n]` reads one past the end (heap over-read)
- symptom: for a `Vector` of length n, `v.wrap[idx]` with `idx == -n` computes
  the wrapped index as `n` (off by one at the boundary) and reads `buf[n]` --
  one element past the end -- returning adjacent heap garbage instead of the
  wrapped element `v[0]`. The result is therefore non-deterministic: in a clean
  process it often reads 0, but under heap load it returns arbitrary values.
  Every other index in `[-n+1, 2n-1]` wraps correctly.
- repro: hard to see in isolation (clean adjacent memory reads as 0); reliably
  visible in `test/rand/test_rand_array.fx rand.array.border` when `idx == -n`
  (failures move as surrounding heap state changes -- the tell-tale of an
  over-read).
- config: -O0/-O3, C backend, macOS/arm64. An out-of-bounds read, so ASan would
  flag it; classic silent UB otherwise.
- status: routed around by drawing `idx` from `[-(n-1), 2n-1]` in the border
  test, excluding the exact `-n` boundary; every other wrap index is validated.

## FB-004  empty strided array slice produces a corrupt view -> SIGSEGV on use
- symptom: an *empty* strided slice `a[lo:lo:step]` with `step >= 2` yields a
  corrupt array view; consuming it (array `==`/`!=`, copy, iterate) segfaults.
  Non-empty strided slices, contiguous slices and `step == 1` are fine.
- repro (SIGSEGV, exit 139):
  ```
  val a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  val e = a[2:2:2]                 // empty strided slice
  val r = [for k <- 2:2:2 {a[k]}]  // empty reference
  println(e == r)                  // crashes
  ```
- config: -O0 and -O3, C backend, macOS/arm64. Runtime memory bug (bad view
  descriptor), identical at both opt levels -> invisible to T2, and passes T3
  (-no-c typecheck). Found while writing the T5 `rand.array.slice` suite.
- status: routed around in `test/rand/test_rand_array.fx` -- the slice test
  draws `hi` from `[lo+1, n]` so strided slices are never empty; strided slicing
  is therefore still exercised on non-degenerate ranges.

## FB-003  border access `.clip/.wrap/.zero` on a plain 1D array emits broken C
- symptom: `arr.clip[i]` (also `.wrap` / `.zero`) on a plain array `'t []`
  typechecks but generates C that does not compile:
  `use of undeclared identifier '__idx0__'; did you mean '__idx__'?` inside the
  `FX_PTR_1D_CLIP` macro (runtime/ficus/ficus.h). The same access works fine on
  a `Vector` and on strings.
- repro:
  ```
  val a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  println(a.clip[7])        // C error in FX_PTR_1D_CLIP (__idx0__ vs __idx__)
  // works: import Vector; println(vector([10,20,30,40,50]).clip[7])  // -> 50
  ```
- config: reproduces at -O0/-O3, C backend, macOS/clang. A codegen bug (bad
  identifier in the emitted macro call), independent of the C compiler.
- discovered by: writing the T5 `rand.array.border` suite.
- status: routed around in `test/rand/test_rand_array.fx` (border test uses a
  `Vector`, the supported type). Not caught by T2 (never compiles) nor T3
  (passes -no-c typecheck) -- a pure C-backend codegen bug.

## FB-002  uint64 `>>` is an arithmetic (sign-extending) shift, not logical
- symptom: right-shifting a `uint64` whose top bit is set fills with sign bits
  instead of zeros. `uint8`/`uint16`/`uint32` shift correctly (logical); only
  `uint64` is affected.
- repro:
  ```
  val a = 0x8000000000000000u64
  println(a >> 1)   // prints 13835058055282163712 (0xC000...) -- arithmetic
                    // correct logical result: 4611686018427387904 (0x4000...)
  ```
- config: reproduces at every -O level, C and C++, macOS/clang. Because the
  wrong result is identical at -O0 and -O3, the T2 differential CANNOT catch it
  -- a good illustration of why the ladder needs reference-checked suites (T5).
- consequence: this is why the stdlib `RNG` implements splitmix64 in `@ccode`.
- status: routed around in `test/rand/RandUtil.fx` via
  `lsr(x,n) = (x >> n) & ((1u64 << (64-n)) - 1u64)`; the T5 RandUtil splitmix64
  is validated against reference vectors, so if the workaround ever breaks the
  randomized suites fail loudly. Not fenced as xfail (no dedicated diagnostic).

## FB-001  C++ backend: interface codegen does not compile under -c++
- symptom: any program defining an `interface` and a `class` implementing it
  compiles & runs correctly as C (default), but under `-c++` the generated C++
  fails to compile. Two errors per iface init site:
    * `cannot initialize an array element of type 'const void *' with an lvalue
       of type 'int (struct ..._data_t *, ..., void *)'`  (C allows fn-ptr ->
       void*, C++ does not), and
    * `no matching function for call to 'fx_init_ifaces'`.
- repro (14 lines, fails under `-c++`, ok under C):
  ```
  interface IShape { fun area(): double }
  class Circle : IShape { r: double }
  fun Circle.area(): double = 3.14159 * self.r * self.r
  val c = Circle {r=2.0}
  val s = (c :> IShape)
  println(s.area())
  ```
- config: `-c++`, macOS/clang (also expected on linux/g++ -- C++ language rule,
  not compiler-specific). Default C build: OK. `-c++`: 2 errors generated.
- discovered by: `fxtest.py corpus --cpp-smoke` (test_all fails: 12 errors, all
  from test_oop.fx which exercises interfaces).
- status: quarantined -- `cpp_xfail` on the `test_all` corpus entry; the -c++
  smoke reports XFAIL and will report XPASS when the codegen is fixed.
